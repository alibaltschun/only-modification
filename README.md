# 🚴 Open Source Bike Modification Simulator 🎮
⚠️ Note: This is still just an idea. I don't have all the answers yet or know exactly how to build it, but that’s where you come in. I need your feedback, ideas, and support to make this vision come to life.

# 💡 The Idea
This project is about creating an open-source simulation focused on motorbike customization and modification. Inspired by the underground racing games we love, but with a twist:

# No racing, just pure modification.
Focus on visuals and creative expression.
A community-driven platform where 3D designs and content are entirely created by users.
The ultimate goal is to provide a space where enthusiasts can build, modify, and showcase their dream bikes.

A bike modification simulator where you can swap parts, apply decals, tweak colors, and more.
Endless creative freedom because the content is driven by User-Generated Content (UGC).
A platform that celebrates customization without worrying about copyright issues.
This isn’t about making a commercial game—it’s about building something fun, creative, and open for everyone.

# 🤔 Why Open Source?
i am worry that if we Pre-designed 3D assets can lead to legal copyright issues. so maybe we need to make the platform first, and let the user make the 3d object. i dont know is this a good idea or not, i really want a real branded 3D object, but we have no legal problem

# 💡 Why Bikes?
Coz iam live in asia, and motorbike are big thing in asia.
and also there is ton of car modifications game/simulator in the market.
